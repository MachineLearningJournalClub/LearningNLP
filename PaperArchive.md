<!-- WHAT NLP PAPER ARCHIVE IS -->
# What NLP Paper Archive is

NLP Paper Archive aims to be a sort of library containing interesting paper talking about Natural Processing. It's organised in topics (i.e. word embedding, ethical application, ecc.) and every paper it's with a description made by important keywords, main questions around which the paper is focused and main ideas proposed.

### Juan Luis Gastaldi (2020), Philosophy & Technology, 34, 149–214


### Keywords 
Distributional Hypotesis, Harris' Distributionalism, Structuralism, Matrix Models, Latent Space
### Questions
* How is it possible that a latent discriminating space underlying the relations between terms and
contexts in a given raw record of linguistic performances succeeds in capturing a surprising amount of
linguistic properties, including syntactic regularities and structures, semantic relatedness,
isomorphic configurations between different languages and historical change? (Chapter 4)
* But what exactly is a context? And what is its precise role in the production of linguistic meaning? (Chapter 4)
### Ideas
* Distributional Hypothesis: You shall know how word by the company it keeps. 
The degree of semantic similarity between two linguistic expressions A and B is a function of the similarity of
the linguistic contexts in which A and B can appear. (Chapter 4)
* “The meaning of a word is defined by the circumstances of its use”(Manning and Schutze, 1999) (Chapter 4)
* Harris' Distributionalism: the distributional chratcter of meaning is perfectly indipendendent from meaning. Harris’s  distributionalism conveys  an  image  of language as an autonomous system of regularities and constraints, not governed byany  external  source  of  meaning.
* Structuralist Hypothesis: the meaning is the effect of the structure.
